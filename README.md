### iHM5C-Deep: A Deep Learning Model based Server to predict hm5c and non-hm5c sites.
### iHM5C-Deep server is based on the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model developed to predict hm5c and non-hm5c sites on providing RNA sequence(s). This proposed prediction model identify the hm5c sites with increased accuracy.
