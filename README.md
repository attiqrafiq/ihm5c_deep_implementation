# iHM5C-Deep: Home
### iHM5C-Deep: A Deep Learning Model based Server to predict hm5c and non-hm5c sites.
### iHM5C-Deep server is based on the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model developed to predict hm5c and non-hm5c sites on providing RNA sequence(s). This proposed prediction model identify the hm5c sites with increased accuracy.
#### ON The basis of this proposed model a web based application has also been developed, which can be used for the identification of 5hmC sites by providing an RNA sequence. The link to the running model is https://hm5c-deeppred.streamlit.app
